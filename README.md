## 💡 Inspiration

The concept for **StudyPay** was inspired by the inefficiencies in handling monetary transactions among students and faculty. Whether it was lending money for school events or sending money to peers for group activities, the need for a simple and centralized payment system was clear. With Firebase as the backend and Figma for rapid prototyping, we set out to create a seamless payment experience.
